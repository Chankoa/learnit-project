# Forge Design System 1.1

## Status and references

DS 1.1 is the shared visual foundation for Creator, Teacher and the future Learner experience. The Teacher Authoring Workspace is its first full application.

Official visual direction:

- `docs/design/ds-1.1-reference-light.png`
- `docs/design/ds-1.1-reference-dark.png`

The images define hierarchy, density and visual intent. The semantic tokens in `styles/tokens.scss` and `styles/themes.scss` remain normative.

## Principles

- Calm, editorial and legible before decorative.
- Structure supports navigation, Editor owns the work, Forge assists.
- Space and typography create hierarchy before borders and cards.
- Violet means system, selection, focus and primary interaction.
- Rose means editorial impulse and creation; it is never a second default primary.
- AI is identifiable through one tinted surface, not stacked purple layers.
- Light and Dark share the same component implementation and semantic token names.

## Audit summary

The pre-DS 1.1 system already had a useful spacing scale and a single token entry point, but several issues reduced consistency:

- `--surface-body` and `--text-soft` were consumed without being defined;
- Dark used rose as `--accent-primary`, reversing the system hierarchy;
- `--radius-md`, `--radius-lg` and `--radius-xl` all resolved to the same value;
- strong weights mapped to 750–900 and were used broadly in Teacher surfaces;
- buttons carried large gradients and shadows regardless of contextual priority;
- the Authoring Workspace accumulated compensating, page-specific borders and surfaces;
- Structure actions and lesson rows had more visual weight than their navigation role required;
- the Forge panel tinted both the container and several nested cards.

Global primitives that serve many legacy surfaces were evolved conservatively. Workspace-specific calibration remains scoped under `.teacher-authoring` to avoid a product-wide visual rewrite.

## Color system

### Semantic roles

| Role | Light | Dark | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `surface-body` | `#fbfafc` | `#0f1117` | application background |
| `surface-panel` | `#ffffff` | `#161a23` | primary work surface |
| `surface-soft` | `#f1f5f9` | `#1d212b` | contextual inset and hover |
| `surface-ai` | `#f8f6ff` | `#17152b` | Forge container |
| `surface-control` | `#ffffff` | `#121722` | inputs and selects |
| `text-primary` | `#0f172a` | `#f1f5f9` | titles and decisive content |
| `text-secondary` | `#475569` | `#cbd5e1` | body copy |
| `text-muted` | `#64748b` | `#9aa5b7` | metadata and supporting copy |
| `border-soft` | `#e2e8f0` | `#2a3142` | default separators |

Compatibility aliases such as `surface-bg`, `surface-muted`, `text-default` and `text-strong` are retained. New work should prefer the semantic roles above when a direct role exists.

### Accents and status

- Violet: `accent-primary`, `accent-primary-strong`, `accent-soft`.
- Rose: `accent-editor`, `accent-editor-soft`.
- Green: success and published.
- Orange: warning, draft and review.
- Red: error and destructive actions.
- Blue: informational state only.

Status colors must not be used decoratively.

## Typography

The body and heading family remain Inter/system sans-serif. No external font was added.

Semantic roles:

| Role | Token | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page title | `font-size-page-title` | 700 |
| Object title | `font-size-object-title` | 700 |
| Section title | `font-size-section-title` | 600 |
| Body | `font-size-body` | 400 |
| Label | `font-size-label` | 600 |
| Caption | `font-size-caption` | 400–500 |

The weight scale now resolves to 400 / 500 / 600 / 700 / 750 / 800. `black` and `extrabold` remain compatibility options, not default component choices. Uppercase eyebrows are reserved for rare structural or editorial markers.

## Spacing

The existing 4 px scale remains authoritative:

`4 · 8 · 12 · 16 · 24 · 32 · 40 · 48 · 64`

Intermediate legacy tokens remain available, but new layout choices should use the core sequence when possible.

- Field internals: 8–12 px.
- Related controls: 12–16 px.
- Section groups: 24–32 px.
- Workspace margins: responsive 20–32 px.

## Surfaces

DS 1.1 uses four levels:

1. `surface-body`: application background;
2. `surface-panel`: primary work surface;
3. `surface-soft`: inset, hover or secondary context;
4. `surface-ai`: Forge context.

Normal sections do not receive a shadow. Separators and spacing replace nested cards. `surface-elevated` and the shadow scale are reserved for drawers, dialogs and floating/sticky controls.

## Radius and shadows

Radius scale:

- `xs`: 4 px;
- `sm`: 6 px;
- `md`: 8 px;
- `lg`: 12 px;
- `xl`: 16 px;
- `2xl`: 20 px.

Shadows are limited to `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `sticky` and the focus ring. Standard cards use no elevation by default.

## Buttons

Supported variants:

- `Primary`: one decisive action in the current context;
- `Secondary`: important supporting action;
- `Tertiary` / `Ghost`: light contextual action;
- `Icon`: compact action with accessible name and tooltip where needed.

Supported sizes are default (`md`) and `sm`. Buttons use semibold text, a flat system accent and restrained shadow. Coarse-pointer contexts preserve a 44 px touch target.

## Forms

Inputs, selects and textareas share:

- `surface-control` background;
- 8 px radius;
- subtle border and violet focus ring;
- 13 px semibold labels;
- 14 px control text;
- role-based textarea heights rather than one oversized default.

The lesson content textarea remains larger than metadata fields but is capped to preserve context on laptop and mobile.

## Tabs

`Informations | Contenu | Ressources` use plain text, a two-pixel violet indicator, medium inactive weight and semibold active weight. On mobile they scroll horizontally instead of wrapping.

## Badges

Badges are compact, semibold and secondary to titles. Their colors communicate real status only. Published, draft, review and destructive/error semantics use the corresponding status tokens.

## Panels

### Structure

Structure behaves as an explorer:

- modules are separated groups rather than cards;
- lessons are compact selectable rows;
- the active lesson uses `accent-soft` plus a vertical violet indicator;
- rose marks the editorial module label only;
- reordering and destructive controls stay accessible but visually secondary.

### Editor

The Editor owns `surface-panel`, limits content width to 60 rem and uses a simple sequence: object header, tabs, work surface, sticky save action. Section separation relies on spacing and one-pixel dividers.

### Forge

The Forge panel itself owns the AI tint. Context, actions, status and proposal use mostly neutral internal surfaces. Violet identifies Forge interactions; nested lavender cards are avoided.

## Responsive

Functional breakpoints remain unchanged:

- desktop large: Structure / Editor / Forge;
- laptop: Forge becomes a drawer;
- tablet: Structure and Forge become temporary panels;
- mobile: Editor occupies the full width.

Mobile tabs scroll horizontally, content padding contracts to 12–16 px, the save action spans the available width, and coarse-pointer icon actions retain 44 px targets.

## Accessibility

- Semantic focus ring shared across themes.
- WCAG-oriented primary and body text contrast.
- Active structure state combines color, weight and an inset indicator.
- Existing `aria-current`, `aria-expanded`, Escape handling and drawer focus trap remain unchanged.
- No interaction depends solely on hover.
- Reduced-motion mode disables decorative transitions.

## Scope and deferred work

DS 1.1 does not refactor every Creator or Learner component. Dashboard, catalogue and authentication inherit the safer global palette, typography weights, radii, buttons and badges; the detailed Workspace calibration stays scoped.

Deferred:

- component catalogue or Storybook;
- automated contrast regression tooling;
- full migration of legacy one-off spacing values;
- Learner-specific composition and content typography;
- Admin visual convergence.
